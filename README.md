# WinFliction-OS

> **Best OS ever, aka project masochism**

A delightfully frustrating parody operating system that captures the true essence of modern computing - endless updates, intrusive notifications, and AI "assistance" you never asked for.

## Demo

## Features

### 🖥️ Authentic Desktop Experience
- **10 Desktop Apps**: Document Editor, Browser, Calculator, Notepad, File Explorer, Terminal, Games, Recycle Bin, Mail, and Photos

### 📊 System Tray (Just Like Real Life™)
- **WiFi**: Connect to networks like "FBI Surveillance Van" and "Neighbor's WiFi"
- **Battery**: Watch your battery drain in real-time (or toggle charging in debug mode)
- **Notifications**: 99+ unread messages about extending your warranty
- **Bluetooth**: Toggle it on/off (it won't actually connect to anything)
- **Volume**: Mute/unmute the annoying sound effects
- **Calendar**: A calendar that shows today's date (revolutionary!)

### 🔄 The Update Experience
- Forced updates at the most inconvenient times
- Progress bars that reset at 99%
- Recovery mode after 5 failed restarts
- Error codes that mean nothing (0x80042069)

### 🤖 AI Assistant
